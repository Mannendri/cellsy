# Cellsy, 2021
A repository for my Columbia ENG (Engineering the Next Generation) final project.

I created this project for the [Kasza Living Materials Laboratory](http://www.kaszalab.com) at Columbia University to help them with their research 
focusing on supracellular myosin networks and morphogenesis. 

This is a Python Graphical User Interface (GUI) created using Kivy (an open-source Python app development framework) that aims to 
highlight the different features of the myosin network in a fruit fly embryo
and compare them to cell outlines simultaneously.

Follow this [link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1udb06ftbr63lLFH-rdh2sWB2qFfq_cD9SBCZ3ZxNb9s/edit?usp=sharing) for more context on the research.
